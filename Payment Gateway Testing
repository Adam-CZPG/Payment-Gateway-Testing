Payment gateways act as a window between the e-commerce website/application and the bank. 
They ensure that the transaction occurs in a secured form by encrypting customer details. 
They make the whole online shopping experience smooth and hassle-free and free us from the stress of online frauds.
With the payment gateways being so important, as they carry a lot of personal information, they must function well and do not fail at any cost.
Therefore, it is important that the payment gateway goes through various testing phases before we associate it with any site.
Let us look at the different testing ways that we must take into consideration before launching a payment gateway.

Functional Testing – This form of testing ensures that the gateway is fully functional with all its features working as specified. 
This helps in verifying that the application page and the gateway, both are behaving in the correct manner.

Performance Testing – This is for ensuring that no matter what number of customers are using the gateway, it should not affect its functioning.

Security – The gateway must go through a secure page and all the data should be encrypted as it contains sensitive information. 
There should be a deep security check before enabling any gateway.
Below are different test cases for each testing phase, created for a fault-free, fully functional payment gateway.

UI Test Cases for Payment Gateway

Check if all the labels and boxes are visible.
Verify the payment gateway company logo or name.
Check if the credit card number is masked or not.
Verify that all the payment options are visible.
Check if the color scheme matches the specifications.


Functional Test Cases for Payment Gateway

Check if each of the payment options is selectable.
Check if the default credit/debit card gets automatically added.
Verify that the page does not proceed to the payment page before all the mandatory information is filled.
Check if multiple cards can be saved as default or not.
Verify that the correct currency is reflected on the page.
Check if the payment is not getting processed for null values in the cart.
Verify if multiple payment options are not getting selected. Only one at a time.
Check if the payment is not getting proceeded with an expired/blocked card.

Verify cases like-

Credit/debit card number+wrong date+ right cvv
Credit/debit card number+ right date+ wrong cvv
Wrong credit/debit card number+ right date+ right cvv
And some other similar combinations

Check if the user gets a confirmation message or mail if the payment is successful.
Check if a pop-up appears if the session has expired.
Verify that the user gets information about unsuccessful payment.
Check if double payment is not occurring in any case.
Check what happens after the session gets expired. Does the payment still occur?
Verify if the respective payment option triggers the right payment gateway.
Check if the user is directed back to the application after a successful transaction.
Check what happens if the payment gets stopped midway. Does the amount still gets deducted?
Check if the pop-up blocker during the payment is functional.
Check if the application page is not getting redirected to some other page or link.




Security Test Cases for Payment Gateway

Verify if the credit card information is in a masked form.
Check that the payment is happening through a secured channel. i.e the link starts with HTTPS instead of the regular HTTP pages.
Verify if the OTP reaches only the verified number linked with the card.
Verify if the transaction gets canceled if the wrong OTP is entered.
Check if it cannot be entered multiple times. A hacker can do a brute force attack by entering various combinations.
Check if the session gets expired within the specified time.
Verify that the person gets notified if the wrong OTP is entered.
Check that it does not reflect on multiples numbers.
Verify the bank name reflecting on the payment page is the same as the user.
Check if the amount deducted is the same as the amount mentioned.


Performance Test Cases for Payment Gateway

Check if the payment gateway does not crash if multiple users are using it simultaneously.
Check if the processor is responding quickly.
Verify the time taken to reach the payment gateway from the application’s page is the same as specified.
Verify if the page is secured from brute force or SQL injection attacks.
Check if once logged in, the back button does not log out the user from the application.
Check if the payment is happening even after the session expires.



Conclusion
While writing test scenarios for things like payment gateways, login pages, bank applications, etc. 
all these scenarios must be kept in mind as they involve sensitive information of the customer.
