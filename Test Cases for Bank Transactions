In this post, youâ€™ll learn how to write test cases for bank transaction. Each bank has itâ€™s own flow for money transfer. 
So it is hard to generalize the flow for all the banks. So I am attempting come up with a flow that most of the banks are likely to have in their own money transfer 
process. You may find a lot of difference depending on the type of the bank that you are using. 

Let me jot down some of the common test steps to follow for this workflow.

Test Steps for Bank Transaction

Go to the bank website login page.
Input username and password.
Go to money transfer page.
Add the beneficiary to whom you want to transfer money.
Check the details of bank account and person. Verify if they are correct.
Select the specific money transfer method from NEFT/RTGS or SWIFT transfer options.
Select the beneficiary name, funds and then submit the details.
Verify the amount and other details on verification page.
Click submit for final action of fund transfer.

These are the test steps which youâ€™ll find with almost every bank in India. 
If you are reading this from another country then the flow of bank transaction may be different. 
For example some of you may have SMS authentication before sending the money. 
Some of you are likely to have other means of verifying the details of beneficiary to avoid sending the money to wrong person. 
But that being said, flow is pretty much the same for most banks.

There is also one more option of the adding beneficiary in the Indian banks. 
So the image below shows the number of fields that you can validate and write test cases for as well.
